CSV2ASCII
=========

Our objective here is to translate the `*.CSV` files generated by the EDF class to a `*.ASCII` files, so they can be used by PROTOLIZE or by EEGLAB.

Current apps
------------

### csv2ascii ###

This app creates as many `*.ASCII` files as there are channels in the `*.CSV` file. Usage:

``` bash
csv2ascii.exe input.csv # will output many x.ascii where x is the name of the channel.
```

### csv2fullascii ###

This program will directly translate the `*.CSV` file to a `*.ASCII` one. Usage:

``` bash
csv2fullascii.exe input.csv # will output an input.ascii file.
```

### some2ascii and MATLAB scripts ###  

These scripts were the first attempt on this problem. They wanted to extracted specific channels from the `*.CSV` file. They might be improved in future so we can create `*.ASCII` files as specified by the user.
