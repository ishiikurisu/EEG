# Description

This folder contains some code made by [me](https://github.com/ishiikurisu) while working as an intern for Neurosciences and behavior laboratory at UnB. It is mainly composed of sketches.

# Projects

This folder works well with the following repositories:

- [Golang implementation of the EDF standard](github.com/ishiikurisu/edf)
- [Applications for dealing with EDF files](github.com/lab-neuro-comp/EDF)
- [SST analysis lib](github.com/ishiikurisu/sst)
- [SST analysis applications](github.com/lab-neuro-comp/SST)

# Sketches

My sketches can be accessed in the [`src`](https://github.com/ishiikurisu/EEG/tree/master/src) folder. Every code here is intended to be run on Windows.

## Beck's Inventories ##

An implementation of the Beck's Depression and anxiety inventories in C#. It's located in the [beck](https://github.com/ishiikurisu/EEG/tree/master/src/beck) folder, and it is meant to be translatable to any language.

It is currently being worked on the [scalemate](https://github.com/ishiikurisu/Scalemate) repository, due to its success. It has been renamed and it is fully growing as its own unique project now.

## Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ##

An implementation of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in Go using [walk](https://github.com/lxn/walk) by @lxn. It is located in the [edinburgh](https://github.com/ishiikurisu/EEG/tree/master/src/edinburgh) folder.

## Benchmarking ##

A small application to clock another app's performance. Nothing fancy.
