Artificial neural network paradigms
===================================

2 kinds of neural networks (NNs):

1. recurrent networks: NNs involved with learning
2. feedforward networks: NNs not involved with learning

the neuron can be modelled as a summing and threshold device. the signficance is in adding a least mean squares (LMS) learning algorithm to moinize the mean-square error function.

The most popular neural networks are:
